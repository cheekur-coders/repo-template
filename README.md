# [repo-template](https://github.com/cheekur-coders/repo-template) - A Repository Template for All Future [@cheekur-coders](https://github.com/cheekur-coders) Projects

[Who What When Where Why How] <br>
Welcome to the [repo-template](https://github.com/cheekur-coders/repo-template) wiki by [@cheekur-coders](https://github.com/cheekur-coders)! [repo-template] is setup in a manner to standardize the documentation across all planned future projects. The goal is to allow for duplication of this repo at the start of a new project to get the documentation rolling. The advantage of using the GitHub Wiki is traceability and edit comments for the documentation. The standardization is required to ensure that documentation is performed irrespective of the size of the project and also help internalize the concepts of software engineering as discussed in "Beginning Sofware Engineering" by Rod Stephens. The standardization is performed by setting up a skeletal wiki pointing to all the important and required documentation for a standard software. 

## Project Description
[repo-template](https://github.com/cheekur-coders/repo-template) is an empty project with a skeletal wiki to aid with quick and easy doc setup for future projects planned by @cheekur-coders.

## Examples
None to show in this repo, but a good idea to showcase what the project can do here.

## Release
No releases here as this is a template construct, good idea to indicate the release version and how to build it.

## Related Projects
Link to any related projects if idea was borrowd or code-base was forked.
